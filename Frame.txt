Frames
To make the game ready for action, we will update the display 50 times per second, which is much like frames in a movie.

First, create a new function called updateGameArea().

In the myGameArea object, add an interval which will run the updateGameArea() function every 20th millisecond (50 times per second). Also add a function called clear(), that clears the entire canvas.

In the component constructor, add a function called update(), to handle the drawing of the component.

The updateGameArea() function calls the clear() and the update() method.
